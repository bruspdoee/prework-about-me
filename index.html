      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p> Coming from a Technical Recruitment background, I've had the chance to collaborate with clients and candidates alike from a 3rd party perspective building out their technology teams and the common feedback on client facing consultants or developers is that they do not have strong enough communication skills. So with my excitement around this field, and the communication skill gap in technology, I want to bridge this gap and take matters into my hands, no longer being a 3rd party in these interactions, but to be a part of the "game"</p>
